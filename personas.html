      <h1>Personas & Storyboard</h1>
      <p>I observed the phone charging station on the bottom floor of the Scili to better understand how and why users interact with the interface. </p>

      <div class="gallery-item-container">
	        <h1>The Interface:</h1>

        <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/interface.png" alt="Diagram of charging station interface in two screens">
		     <p>This interface allows the user to utilize an available charger and securely store their device while doing so. It features an interactive screen
			 and compartments containing charging cables that only open after a password is chosen (when charging) or correctly entered (when retrieving).
</p>
			 <h1>Observations:</h1>
<li>Most users knew what to do at the interface and took no more than 30 seconds, either when charging or retrieving</li>
<li>Did not need to stop to read the screen and knew where the buttons were and what they did; little physical or emotional reaction</li>
<li>Users used the interface to store their phones when first entering the Scili, but when not everyone left after retrieving</li>
<li>Several times, someone forgot that they had set an alarm and it rang in the charger</li>

			 <h1>Interview Points:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Was the interface easy to use/was there any part of the interface you didn't understand the first time?</li>
<ul><li>All the respondents said the interface was intuitive and had no trouble, even as a first time user.</li></ul>
<li>Did you have any suggestions as to how the interface could be improved/do you feel satisfied with the design of the interface?</li>
<ul><li>No suggestions were made; respondents said they were satisfied with the interface.</li></ul>
<li>Any other comments?</li>
<ul><li>Respondents pointed out the security and convenience of the interface: they did not have to interact with another person and could leave their phone for a long time while studying</li></ul>

</ul>
			  <h1>Personas:</h1>
	      <p>Using the observations and interview responses, I constructed the following personas and storyboard to demonstrate users of the interface: </p>
        <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/persona1.png" alt="Persona of Sarah, a forgetful student">
        <p>Sarah is a student who is forgetful. She works in the Scili but often stops to chat with her friends. She uses the charger because her phone is almost dead. </p>

		<img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/persona2.png" alt="Persona of Sam, a student who is working on a project">
				<p>Sam is a student who is stressed because he has a project due soon. He is using the device to both charge his phone and to leave it out of his reach so he can focus on his work. </p>
		
		      <h1>Storyboard for Sam:</h1>

        <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard of Sam">
