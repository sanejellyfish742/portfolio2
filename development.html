      <h1>Development</h1>
      <h5><p>For this project, I designed a web app to demonstrate filtering, sorting, and aggregating items using the React framework. </p></h5>

      <!-- TODO: PART I Add your own images and use CSS flex to make sure they work on different screen sizes -->
      <div class="gallery-item-container">
	        <h1>Problem:</h1>
			The objective of the project was to use React, as well as properties and state, to build a fluid application. I chose an existing system that I felt was lacking that would make sense in the context of having an aggregator like a shopping cart. 
			
			<br>There are many classrooms and conference rooms available in the CS building, or CIT, to be reserved for activities like meetings and TA hours. The CIT website provides information like the equipment available and the capacity, but rooms had to be reserved separately via email or forms, with different groups handling different rooms.
        
		<br>I decided to remake it into a mockup of a simple, uniform way to view and book the rooms.
		<h1>The Interface:</h1>
		In the new room reservation interface, each room occupies its own flexbox. Accompanying the room are its capacity, boolean indicating whether it contains AV or computers, and a picture of its layout (which were all photographed by me). When the "add" button is pressed, it is added to the list of selected rooms, which is displayed at the bottom of the page.
		Rooms can be removed by clicking the "remove" button in each box or by deleting all items from the cart. 
		<br>
		I also include a fixed navbar on the side for filtering/sorting. Each button or box is clearly labeled with its function.
			  <h2>Props</h2>
			  All the information about the rooms was stored in a json file, with each room containing name, description, capacity, image, and computers and AV fields. These properties can be passed to React components like the box and aggregator to be displayed.
			  <h2>State</h2>
			  I use a set, an implementation of JavaScript arrays, to keep track of the items in the cart. This limits each room from only being added to the cart once, since it would not make sense to add a room multiple times. The state variable is the one keeping track of what rooms have been added to the cart.
			  <br>When the items in the cart are rendered, the function also sums up all the capacities of the items and shows the total capacity to the user.
			  <h2>Filtering & Sorting</h2>
To filter the list, the map from the list of rooms to the render element includes a ternary if operator. series of boolean expressions: 
for example, if neither filter is on, then every element is displayed; if the AV filter is on, then an element is displayed if its "has AV?" value is 1 and not displayed if it is 0, using Javascript true-false values.
<br> For sorting, I pre-sort the rooms by capacity, both ascending and descending, and store them locally in separate arrays when rendering the page. Pressing the sort buttons then changes which array is loaded, including one button that loads the original.
			  <h1>Final App:</h1>

			<p> Click the image below to go the app! Note that it does not actually allow you to reserve rooms and navigates out of the portfolio.

	<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
	I was able to leverage React and combine it with the HTML and CSS I already learned to design and deploy a web app to solve a problem. If this app is integrated with CIT management, it could be of use to customers.
