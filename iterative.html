      <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
      <h5><p>For this project, I and a team of other students designed an interface to fulfill a startup's mission. </p></h5>

      <!-- TODO: PART I Add your own images and use CSS flex to make sure they work on different screen sizes -->
      <div class="gallery-item-container">
	        <h1>Planning:</h1>
			The rising startup <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/dimorder">DimOrder</a> brands itself as a "Toast for Southeast Asia." We liked the idea, so we wanted to help make an interface for the business. While the startup's mission was to provide a one-stop shop for restauranteurs to interact with both customers and suppliers, our group narrowed our approach to the point of sale system used by servers in the restaurant itself.
        We felt that this app alone would give us enough freedom in design while not being forced to spread ourselves too thin. Furthermore, we designed the interface for a tablet, as it was a low-cost solution likely to be used in restaurants.
			  <h1>Prototypes:</h1>
			  Like in the <a href="redesign.html">Redesign</a> project, I made both lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes for the design. The lo-fi prototypes represented my original ideas before seeing the other group members' designs. 
			 
			 <br><div class="row">
<div class="column">
			 <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/iterative3.png" alt="Screenshot of lo-fi prototype 3"></div>
			 <div class="ms-auto column bd-highlight"><img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/iterative2.png" alt="Screenshot of lo-fi prototype 2"></div>
			 <div class="ms-auto column bd-highlight"><img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/iterative1.png" alt="Screenshot of lo-fi prototype 1">
			</div></div> 
			 The hi-fi prototypes were done as a group. We decided on what screens and interactions our app would have and split it into sections that we individually "programmed" in Figma.
			 <h1>Iteration:</h1>
			We attended a studio where we presented our app to an industry expert as well as our peers to get feedback on our design. 
			We also submitted our interactive Figma prototype to the site <a href="https://usertesting.com">usertesting.com</a> along with a list of tasks to simulate what it would be like to actually use the app.
			
			<br>With these critiques in mind, we made improvements to the prototype like adding more information to screens and ways to undo like delete and back.
			  <h1>Final App:</h1>
My initial contributions that were included in the final app were the list view that displays a table's status at a glance; and the dropdown menu to add an item to an order. The Figma prototype is below:

<h1>Group Submission:</h1>
<p>We submitted our design for peer critique as well as an email to the company explaining our mission. However, we did not elicit a response from the latter.

<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
	In this project, I learned to combine ideas and produce a larger project with a group of other designers. We were able to take visions that each of us had for the app and polish it into a product.
	I also understood the importance of user testing and the feedback loop in perfecting a design, since what the designers had in mind might not match what the users experience.
