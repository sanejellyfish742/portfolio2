      <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
      <h5><p>For this project, I took the page of a website that had usability issues and added responsive elements that adapt across different screen sizes, culminating in a final design. </p></h5>

      <!-- TODO: PART I Add your own images and use CSS flex to make sure they work on different screen sizes -->
      <div class="gallery-item-container">
	        <h1>Original Page:</h1>

        <a href="http://gcbpvd.org"><img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/gcb.png" alt="Screenshot of Grad Center Bar website"></a>
		     <p>I chose the <a href="http://gcbpvd.org">Grad Center Bar website</a> because when I was looking for information about the bar, 
			 <br>I was frustrated 
			 by the layout of the website, as well as how little information the website itself offered.
</p>
			 <h2>Usability & Accessibility Issues:</h2>
			 I quantified some of the problems a user would encounter when trying to navigate the site.
			 <br>
			 			 <h3>Usability</h3>

			 <ul>

<li>The screen is dark and text is hard to read</li>
<li>No indication of what page the user is currently on or where to find information other than one header</li>
<li>Several extraneous buttons that do not do anything</li>
<li>Text size is constant, resulting in it being cut off on smaller screens</li>
</ul>

			 <h3>Accessibility</h3>
			 For accessibility problems, I ran the website through the WebAIM WAVE tool, which confirmed some of my experiences.
<ul>
<li>There was not enough contrast between the background and the text, even with the black boxes in the background of white text</li>
<li>There were only three links in the header, and two of them pointed to the same page (home page)</li>
<li>Lack of headers, since every text in the body was the same size</li>
<li>Missing alt text for images</li>

</ul>
			  <h1>Prototypes:</h1>
			  To address these issues, first, I made three lo-fi prototypes of the responsive redesigned website, along with annotations of key layout designs with usability and responsiveness in mind.
			  <br>
			
			  <br>
			  <h2>Low-fidelity (Balsamiq)</h2>
			  <div class="row">
<div class="column">
        <img class="gallery-item" width="100%" src="./assets/wf1.png" alt="Wireframe of redesign on phone">
		<p>375x667px Phone
		</div><div class="ms-auto column bd-highlight">

		<img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/wf2.png" alt="Wireframe of redesign on tablet">
		<p>768x1024px Tablet
		</div><div class="ms-auto column bd-highlight">

		<img class="gallery-item" width="50%" src="./assets/wf3.png" alt="Wireframe of redesign on computer">
		<p> 3840x2160px Computer
</div>
</div>
        		      <h2>Visual Guide</h2>

		I then made a visual design style guide of what elements would be present in my website. Based on the colors of the original websitem, I chose the colors from a palette generator, <a href="https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF">Paletton</a>.
		<br>Since the redesign was only of the front page, there would not be that many distinct elements.
		<br>
		<div class="ms-auto column bd-highlight">
		        <img class="gallery-item" width="40%" src="./assets/vsg.png" alt="Visual design style guide of website">
</div>
		      <h2>High-fidelity (Figma)</h2>
From there, I created high-fidelity mockups of the wireframes using Figma and added what specific html/css elements would be used.
<br><br>
<div class="row">
<div class="ms-auto column bd-highlight">
        <img class="gallery-item" width="80%" src="./assets/pt1.png" alt="Prototype of phone redesign">
		<p>375x667px Phone
		</div><div class="ms-auto column bd-highlight">

		<img class="gallery-item" width="50%" src="./assets/pt2.png" alt="Prototype of redesign on tablet">
		<p>768x1024px Tablet
		</div><div class="ms-auto column bd-highlight">

		<img class="gallery-item" width="50%" src="./assets/pt3.png" alt="Prototype of redesign on computer">
		<p> 3840x2160px Computer</div>
	</div>	
		<h1>Final Redesign:</h1>

			<p>After the high-fidelity mockups, I used Bootstrap navbar elements and flexbox to shape the site into the format I desired, which ended up being slightly modified from the mockup.
			<br>I reused elements from the original page like images and text to conform to the theme of the original.
			Click the image below to go the finished redesigned site. Try viewing with different screen sizes!

	<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
		For this project, I was able to spot and remedy design flaws and incorporate responsive elements into a derivative design. I hope you agree that the redesign fixes the issues.
		I also honed my skill in prototyping tools, Balsamiq and Figma, by building up my ideas from a basic level to a fully finished product.
